# Example Terraform Variables File for Basic Azure Resource Group
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update the values for your environment
# This is a simple example for the basic Terraform configuration

# Basic Azure Configuration
# Uncomment and set these if you want to make the configuration more flexible

# Example variables that could be added to make this more configurable:
# resource_group_name = "rg-terraform-001"
# location           = "Australia East"
# 
# tags = {
#   project     = "terraform-learning"
#   owner       = "your-name"
#   environment = "dev"
#   created_by  = "terraform"
# }

# Notes:
# - Currently this terraform configuration uses hardcoded values
# - Consider refactoring to use variables for better flexibility
# - Add variables.tf file to make this configuration more reusable
# 
# Suggested improvements:
# 1. Create variables.tf with:
#    - resource_group_name variable
#    - location variable  
#    - tags variable
# 2. Update main.tf to use var.resource_group_name instead of hardcoded name
# 3. Apply consistent naming conventions (fix "terrform" typo to "terraform")
