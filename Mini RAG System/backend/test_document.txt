This is a test document for the RAG system.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful AI technique that combines:
1. Information retrieval from a knowledge base
2. Text generation using large language models

Key Components:
- Vector Database: Stores document embeddings for similarity search
- Text Splitter: Breaks documents into manageable chunks
- Embedding Model: Converts text to numerical vectors
- Language Model: Generates responses based on retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- Provides up-to-date information
- Reduces hallucination in AI responses
- Allows AI to work with domain-specific knowledge
- Enables question-answering over private documents

This Mini RAG System uses:
- FAISS for vector storage
- HuggingFace embeddings for text vectorization
- Google Gemini for response generation
- FastAPI for the backend API
- React for the frontend interface

The system can process PDF documents and answer questions based on their content.
